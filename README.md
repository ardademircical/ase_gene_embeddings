# Early work on gene-level embeddings for Allele-Specific Expressions (bulk sequences)

Notebook includes data prep, self-supervised model, training + eval loops, primitive UMAPs for ASE classification.

Update (March 7, 2024): Tried using gene embeddings from Geneformer and finetune, results still not great. Input-outputs are too sparse.
