# Early work on gene-level embeddings for Allele-Specific Expressions (bulk)

Notebook includes data prep, self-supervised model, training + eval loops, primitive UMAPs for ASE embeddings.


# Updates

* February 12, 2024: Training data is too sparse, better off keeping ASE-related work as downstream tasks for DNA/RNA language models.

* March 7, 2024: Tried using gene embeddings from Geneformer and finetune, results still not great. ~~Input-outputs are too sparse.~~

* March 8, 2024: Bug fix, results better now.
