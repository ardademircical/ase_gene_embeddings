# Early work on gene-level embeddings for Allele-Specific Expressions (bulk sequences)

Notebook includes data prep, self-supervised model, training + eval loops, primitive UMAPs for ASE classification.

Conclusion: training data too sparse, better off keeping ASE-related work as downstream tasks for DNA/RNA language models.
